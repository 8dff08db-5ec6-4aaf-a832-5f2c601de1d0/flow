# Accounts, Keys and Signing

Flow introduces new features to give applications and end-users more safety and flexibility when managing keys, accounts and the assets inside them.

## Accounts

An account on Flow is a record in the chainstate that holds the following information:

- **Address** - unique identifier for the account
- **Balance** - default token balance
- **Public Keys** - public keys authorized on the account
- **Contracts** - Cadence contracts deployed to the account
- **Resource Storage** - area of the account used to store resource assets

### Account creation

Unlike networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin, Flow does not use cryptographic public keys to derive account addresses. Instead, accounts have unique IDs that are deterministically generated by the network. 

This allows for multiple public keys to be associated with one account, or for a single public key to be used across several accounts.

Users must submit an _account creation transaction_ to create a new account. These transactions behave like any other transaction, and therefore must have a payer.

> Who will pay to create my account?

Account creation fees are relatively low, and we expect that wallet providers and exchanges will cover the cost when a user converts fiat to crypto for the first time.

_Conceptually, this isn't much different than Ethereum or Bitcoin. Although private keys can "reserve" account addresses off-chain, new accounts aren't visible to the network until somebody submits (and pays for) a transaction to that address._

> What about smart contracts?

Ethereum draws a distinction between accounts and contracts, both of which are addressable. Contracts are immutable and cannot be upgraded after deployment. To achieve the same in Flow, simply create an account with `contracts` but no authorized `publicKeys`.

## Keys

Flow accounts can be configured with multiple public keys that are used to control access.

### Adding a key to an account

When adding a public key to an account, you must specify the following information:

- Index (used to identify key within an account)
- Raw public key (encoded as bytes)
- Signature algorthim (see codes below)
- Hashing algorithm (see codes below)
- Weight (integer between 1-1000)

The signature and hashing algorthim must be specified so that signatures generated by a variety of algorithms and curves are supported.

> How are keys added to an account?

To add keys to an account, you can submit a transaction that is authorized to access that account.

### Supported signature & hashing algorithms

Flow will have initial support for a pre-defined set of signature and hash pairings, but more curves and algorithms will be added in the future.

**Signature Algorithms** 

| Algorithm    | Curve     | ID              | Code |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------|------|
| ECDSA        | P-256     | ECDSA_P256      | 2    |
| ECDSA        | SECp256k1 | ECDSA_SECp256k1 | 3    |

**Hashing Algorithms**

| Algorithm    | Size      | ID              | Code |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------|------|
| SHA-2        | 256       | SHA2_256        | 1    |
| SHA-2        | 384       | SHA2_384        | 2    |
| SHA-3        | 256       | SHA3_256        | 3    |
| SHA-4        | 384       | SHA3_384        | 4    |

**Compatibility Table**

|                 | SHA2_256 | SHA2_384 | SHA3_256 | SHA3_384 |
|-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| ECDSA_P256      | ✅       | ✅       | ✅       | ✅       |
| ECDSA_SECp256k1 | ✅       | ✅       | ✅       | ✅       |

### Weighted keys

Each account key has a weight that determines the signing power it holds. A transaction is not authorized to access an account unless it has a total signature weight greater than or equal to `1000`, the weight threshold.

For example, an account might contain the following keys:

- Key Index: 1, Weight: 500
- Key Index: 2, Weight: 500
- Key Index: 3, Weight: 500

This represents a 2-of-3 multisig quorum, in which the account is authorized if at least 2 out of 3 keys sign the account.

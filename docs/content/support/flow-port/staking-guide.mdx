title: Flow Port Staking Guide
---

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for using the Flow Port to stake your FLOW tokens and start eraning rewards.
Currently, Flow Port only supports staking or delegating using tokens held in Blocto or Ledger wallets.

## First Step

Within Flow Port, navigate to the ‘Stake & Delegate’ page to see details about your existing stake and/or delegate.
This will also show you the rewards you have earned for your stake/delegate:

From here, you can do a few different things with your rewards:

- You can choose to **re-stake** them to the associated node.
- You can choose to **withdraw** them to your wallet.

## Re-staking

Flow Port will not automatically re-stake your rewards.
To re-stake your rewards, simply hover your cursor over the 3 dots next to the rewards field:

Click on the Restake option. This will take you to a screen that looks like the below. Input the amount of rewards you want to re-stake, acknowledge the transaction inputs and click submit:

Once the transition is processed, you can reference the Stake & Delegate page again to see the pending stake now:

## Withdraw your Rewards

To withdraw your rewards, simply hover your cursor over the 3 dots next to the rewards field, and click on ‘Withdraw’.

Once the transition is processed, you can now see the withdrawn rewards in your balance and you are now free to do other actions with them (send them to other accounts, delegate to a node, etc).

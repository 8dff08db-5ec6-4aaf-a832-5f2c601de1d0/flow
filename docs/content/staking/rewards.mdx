## Rewards

Rewards are paid out at the end of each [epoch](/staking/#epochs) to all the users that have tokens staked.
Rewards are considered to be unlocked and liquid, so the user can withdraw their rewards
at any time.

More information about the rewards calculation and schedule will be provided in the near future.

If you staked using a 3rd party staking provider such as Kraken, Blocto or Finoa, please read [our guides](/staking/custody-providers/) for more information about how
to claim and use your rewards via your chosen provider.

## Rewards Calculation

|                           | First Month | Month 12 - 18 | Months 19+ |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Total rewards % (Annual)  | 20%         | 5%            | 3%         |
| % of tokens staked        | 80-100%     | ~50%          | ~30%       |
| Staking reward % (Annual) | 20-25%      | ~10%          | ~10%       |

**NB**: In months 2-18, Dapper Labs, Ecosystem, and team allocations will not be fully staked <br/>
**NB2**: % of tokens staked expected to go down over time as different use-cases emerge<br/>
**NB3**: Annualized inflation = (Annualized Reward â€“ Transaction Fees)

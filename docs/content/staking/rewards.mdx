## Rewards

Rewards are paid out at the end of each [epoch](/staking/#epochs) to all the users that have tokens staked.
Rewards are considered to be unlocked and liquid, so the user can withdraw their rewards
at any time.

More information about the rewards calculation and schedule will be provided in the near future.

If you staked using a 3rd party staking provider such as **Kraken**, **Blocto** or **Finoa**, please read [our guides](/staking/custody-providers/) for more information about how
to claim and use your rewards.

## Using Rewards

The process for collecting and using reward payouts will be different depending on how your tokens were staked.
If you staked tokens using a custody provider, see [our guides](/staking/custody-providers/) for
details about how to claim your rewards.

#### Once you've claimed your rewards you can:

- Re-stake to earn compounding rewards! Most custody providers will automatically re-stake your rewards. (Some do not).
  For details about re-staking related to your chosen custody provider see [our guides](/staking/custody-providers/).
  **Note:** If you would like to stake a different node than you're currently staking, you may need to contact you custody provider directly.

- Deposit your rewards in another Flow account. Or, divide your rewards between multiple accounts. This will
  require coordination with the Flow team and the custody provider, as a custom Cadence trasnaction will need to be written that supports
  transferring tokens from acocunts created by your provider.

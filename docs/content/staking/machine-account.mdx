### What is a Machine Account?

Epochs introduce the requirement for protocol software to interact directly with system smart contracts by submitting transactions. 
In particular, consensus nodes submit transactions to the `FlowDKG` smart contract to broadcast DKG messages, 
and collection nodes submit a transaction to the `FlowClusterQC` smart contract to submit root QC votes. To accomplish this, 
the protocol software needs access to a Flow account, which we call the machine account.

    The machine account does not have access to staked tokens and is intended to be used by software, not by humans.

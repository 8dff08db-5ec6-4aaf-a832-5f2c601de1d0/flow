Before starting your journey on Flow we recommend reading the <a href="https://www.onflow.org/primer">Flow Primer</a>. It's a quick introduction to how the Flow blockchain works. It will be easier to understand the things you find here if you have a basic idea of how Flow works.

## Install Flow

To work with Flow locally you'll need to install the <a href="https://github.com/onflow/flow/blob/master/docs/cli.md#flow-cli">Flow CLI</a>.
The Flow CLI is a command-line interface that provides useful utilities for building Flow applications, including the [Flow Emulator](/emulator).

<MenuTitle>OSX & Linux</MenuTitle>

```

<MenuTitle>Windows</MenuTitle>

```powershell
iex "& { $(irm 'https://storage.googleapis.com/flow-cli/install.ps1') }"

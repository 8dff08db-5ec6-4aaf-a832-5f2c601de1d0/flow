issued by [Prime Trust](https://www.primetrust.com/), 
that, on MainNet, is backed 1:1 against USD. 

# Purpose
FUSD is a 1:1 dollar backed stablecoin which is issued as a fungible token on the Flow network.

The volatility of crypto can be incredibly challenging for businesses to deal with and this offers developers on Flow an alternative.

## Mainnet

### Ramp

[Ramp](https://ramp.network/) provides an FUSD payment 
widget that can be embedded directly into your application
for simplified user onboarding.

### Blocto Swap (coming soon)

This page will be updated once FUSD is tradable on Blocto Swap.

--- 

## Testnet

### Blocto Swap

FUSD is available on Testnet through the 
[Blocto Swap decentralized exchange](https://swap-testnet.blocto.app/) (DEX).

You can exchange (swap) Testnet FLOW for 
Testnet FUSD using a Blocto wallet.
If you don't have a Blocto wallet on Testnet,
you can create one directly from the Blocto Swap app.

Once the FUSD is in your Blocto wallet,
you can transfer to any Testnet address that has an FUSD receiver.

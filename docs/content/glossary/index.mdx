# Flow Glossary

## All words and definitions related to Blockchain and Flow

## **A**

## Authentication
[Authentication](https://docs.onflow.org/fcl/reference/authentication/) is the mechanism to verify that a given user is who they claim 
to be. Wallets perform this check. FCL facilitates auth on Flow.

## Authorization
Authorization is the mechanism that verifies that the user intends a prompted user action. The user has to authorize an action to create/update a record on the blockchain. 
FCL helps with authorization by facilitating the transaction signing process

## Authorization Envelope
The transaction authorization envelope contains both the [transaction payload](https://docs.onflow.org/concepts/transaction-signing/#payload) and the payload signatures.

## Authorizers
[Authorizers](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-go-sdk/#transactions) are accounts that authorize a transaction to read and mutate their 
resources. A transaction can specify zero or more authorizers, depending on how many accounts the transaction needs to access.

## Account
An [account](https://docs.onflow.org/concepts/accounts-and-keys/#accounts) on Flow is a record in the chain state that holds 
the address, balance, public keys, Cadence contracts deployed to the account, and storage.

## Account Balance
The [account balance](https://docs.onflow.org/concepts/accounts-and-keys/#accounts) is the number of tokens available in your 
wallet. 

## Account storage
The area of the [account](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/accounts/#account-storage) used to store resource assets.

## Address
A blockchain address is like a bank account for crypto assets. Every address is unique, and they are 26-35 alphanumeric characters in length. 
They are generated from the private key, which is required to send or receive data from one address to another.

## Access node
[Access nodes](https://docs.onflow.org/node-operation/node-roles/#access) act as a proxy to the Flow network. The Access node routes 
transactions to the correct Collection node and routes state queries to available nodes (while likely caching state to answer queries 
on time in the future).

## **B**

## Block
Blocks are data structures within the blockchain, where transaction data in a blockchain are permanently recorded.

## Blocto
[Blocto](https://portto.com/) is a wallet that can handle authentication and authorization and is meant to address long-standing issues with private key management, 
transaction fees, and complicated wallet addresses.

## Blockchain
Blockchain is an organized collection of information that typically encrypts and stores its data in block form and then chains them 
together, making it difficult to hack, change, or cheat; also, it is immutable.

## Block explorer
Block explorer is an interface that allows users to search for information from and about a blockchain,
which includes retrieving individual transactions, activity associated with specific addresses, 
and information about the network. There are two block explorers live today, which are  [Flowscan](https://flowscan.org/) 
and [Bigdipper](https://flow.bigdipper.live/).

## **C**

specific fields and functions of a stored object. 

## CLI
A command-line interpreter or command-line processor uses a command-line interface (CLI) to receive commands from a user through lines of 
text.

## Contract
A [contract](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/contracts/) in Cadence is a collection of type definitions of 
interfaces, structs, resources, data (its state), and code (its functions) that lives in the contract storage area of an account in Flow.

## Collection
[Collection](https://docs.onflow.org/node-operation/node-roles/#collection) nodes are bandwidth-optimized nodes divided by the protocol 
into several cooperating Clusters.

## Consensus
[Consensus](https://docs.onflow.org/node-operation/node-roles/#consensus) nodes form and propose blocks like traditionally-structured 
proof-of-stake blockchains, using the HotStuff consensus algorithm to create a globally consistent chain of blocks.

## Custodial model
The [custodial model](https://docs.onflow.org/nft-marketplace/#custodial-vs-non-custodial-model) for an NFT marketplace is where the 
platform controls all the user accounts, the associated private keys, and, therefore, the assets in those accounts.

## **D**

> **Winner: Congratulations to the flippers!** üèÜ

#### Challenge Summary 

Build a graphical user interface (GUI) that simplifies the network state into visual elements, allows for simple interactions, and is optimized for debugging and inspecting the Flow blockchain state.

### [Events indexing service](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/15)

> **Winner: Congratulations to chris615_dad2 (chriswayoub)!** üèÜ

#### Challenge Summary 

When an event occurs, the application will update its internal state (e.g. a database) or notify its users of the on-chain activity. Many teams have integrated event tracking systems directly into their application infrastructure, but this is a common enough problem that it warrants a simple and general-purpose solution that can serve all teams.

      <th>Team Name</th>
      <th align="center">Github Username(s)</th>

> **Winner: Congratulations to nagato1_c511 (knagato)!** üèÜ

#### Challenge Summary 

Community members have already published some translated documents (e.g. Vietnamese version), but the basic functionality of changing the language on the Learning Hub has not been implemented yet.

---

### Dev Wallet: [Improve OpenID implementation](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/10)

#### Challenge Summary 

Dapps should be able to define and request user information (as per OpenID Standards) from FCL compatible wallet providers so that they can associate the account address with identity fields.

---

### Flow Emulator: [Report gas used](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/12)

> **Winner: Congratulations to nagato1_c511 (avcdsld)!** üèÜ

#### Challenge Summary 

There should be a way to see transaction gas (computation) usage.

---

### Flow Emulator: [Bootstrap with default contracts](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/27)

> **Winner: Congratulations to the FlashyTigers!** üèÜ

#### Challenge Summary

The emulator should be able to deploy contracts when it starts up. For Example:

---

### Flow CLI: [Hot Command](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/14)

> **Winner: Congratulations to saksham214_1499 (sakshamb2113)!** üèÜ

#### Challenge Summary 

The flow CLI should be customized to provide easy access to common commands.

---

### Flow CLI: [State management](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/22)

> **Winner: Congratulations to the Non Fungibles!** üèÜ

#### Challenge Summary

Flow developers use the playground to learn, experiment, and share Cadence code. The current playground model only supports a single account to have a single contract. We want to expand this feature to hold multiple contracts per account.

---

### Flow CLI: [Launch FCL development wallet](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/11)

> **Winner: Congratulations to bluesign!** üèÜ

#### Challenge Summary

This effort proposes bundling the dev wallet server as part of the emulator, and starting the wallet service alongside the emulator when working locally, removing the necessity for users to configure and run the dev wallet docker container manually.

---

### Flow Playground: [Markdown READMEs](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/18)

> **Winner: Congratulations to Team Exponential!** üèÜ

#### Challenge Summary 

The goal of this task is to add a feature to the playground that allows developers to add a written description to their projects, similar to README files in git repositories.

---

### Flow Playground: [Multiple contracts per account](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/21)

> **Winner: Congratulations to squidplay!** üèÜ

#### Challenge Summary 

Flow developers use the playground to learn, experiment, and share Cadence code. The current playground model only supports a single account to have a single contract. We want to expand this feature to hold multiple contracts per account.

---

### Flow Playground: [Improve the resource explorer](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/29)

> **Winner: Congratulations to the Team Exponential!** üèÜ

#### Challenge Summary

In the playground, the resource explorer is the tab the shows the resources inside each account. It is hidden initially and only shows up once you interact with an account's storage. But even then, it only shows up after you click an account, which usually decouples the view a transaction that updates the stored resources.

---

### Flow Playground: [Fix client-side errors in the playground frontend](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/58)

---

### FCL: [Calculate the transaction hash](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/24)

> **Winner: Congratulations to the nagato1_c511!** üèÜ

> **Winner: Congratulations to the Team Exponential!** üèÜ

#### Challenge Summary 

The JS Testing Framework has two functions: sendTransaction and executeScript that currently return a single result from their execution. It does not have a good way of handling errors that should be caught and processed. This can cause issues with multiple interactions called in succession.

---

### Improve Existing SDK: [Python](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/46)

> **Winner: Congratulations to the barekati!** üèÜ

#### Challenge Summary 

Improve the Python SDK to meet the `onflow/sdks` guidelines.

---

### VS Code Extension: [Architecture improvements](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/3)

#### Challenge Summary

---

## New Standards

### [NFT metadata](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/16)

> **Winner: Congratulations to the Non Fungibles!** üèÜ

#### Challenge Summary 

The current Flow NFT interface, however, does not include a metadata standard that allows these representations to flourish. NFTs should be able to include structured data, images, videos and other types of data.

---

### [Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) on Flow](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/17)

> **Winner: Congratulations to the mwufi!** üèÜ

#### Challenge Summary 

Flow could benefit from dedicated DID infrastructure for interoperating Flow identities with services outside of Flow, such as decentralized data storage and credential verification systems.

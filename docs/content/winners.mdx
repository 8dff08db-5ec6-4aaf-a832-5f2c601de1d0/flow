--- 

## VS Code Extension: [Architecture improvements](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/3)

### Issue Summary

The VS Code extension architecture could be improved so the extension becomes lighter and only handles the communication with the language server and the UI.

---

## CryptoDappy Feature: [NFT Marketplace](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/5)

> **Winner: Congratulations to phillip62_a774 (ph0ph0)!** 🏆

### Issue Summary

We want to give users the experience to list their Dappies (NFTs) for sale in order to sell them to other buyers, and give buyers a chance to purchase Dappies of other users.

---

## CryptoDappy Feature: [localization (I18n) solution](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/6)

> **Winner: Congratulations to nagato1_c511 (knagato)!** 🏆

### Issue Summary

Community members have already published some translated documents (e.g. Vietnamese version), but the basic functionality of changing the language on the Learning Hub has not been implemented yet.

---

## Dev Wallet Feature: [Improve OpenID implementation](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/10)

### Issue Summary

Dapps should be able to define and request user information (as per OpenID Standards) from FCL compatible wallet providers so that they can associate the account address with identity fields.

---


## CLI Feature: [Launch FCL development wallet](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/11)

> **Winner: Congratulations to bluesign!** 🏆

### Issue Summary

This effort proposes bundling the dev wallet server as part of the emulator, and starting the wallet service alongside the emulator when working locally, removing the necessity for users to configure and run the dev wallet docker container manually.

---

## Emulator Feature: [Report gas used](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/12)

> **Winner: Congratulations to nagato1_c511 (avcdsld)!** 🏆

### Issue Summary

There should be a way to see transaction gas (computation) usage.

---

## CLI Feature: [Hot Command](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/14)

> **Winner: Congratulations to saksham214_1499 (sakshamb2113)!** 🏆

### Issue Summary

The flow CLI should be customized to provide easy access to common commands.

---

## New Tool: [Events indexing service](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/15)

> **Winner: Congratulations to chris615_dad2 (chriswayoub)!** 🏆

### Issue Summary

When an event occurs, the application will update its internal state (e.g. a database) or notify its users of the on-chain activity. Many teams have integrated event tracking systems directly into their application infrastructure, but this is a common enough problem that it warrants a simple and general-purpose solution that can serve all teams.


---

## New Standard: [NFT metadata](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/16)

> **Winner: Congratulations to the Non Fungibles!** 🏆

### Issue Summary

The current Flow NFT interface, however, does not include a metadata standard that allows these representations to flourish. NFTs should be able to include structured data, images, videos and other types of data.

---

## New Standard: [Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) on Flow](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/17)

> **Winner: Congratulations to the mwufi!** 🏆

### Issue Summary

Flow could benefit from dedicated DID infrastructure for interoperating Flow identities with services outside of Flow, such as decentralized data storage and credential verification systems.

---

## Playground Feature: [Markdown READMEs](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/18)

> **Winner: Congratulations to Team Exponential!** 🏆

### Issue Summary

The goal of this task is to add a feature to the playground that allows developers to add a written description to their projects, similar to README files in git repositories.

---

## New Tool: [Add Cadence support for IntelliJ Platform](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/19)

> **Winner: Congratulations to freeflowers!** 🏆

### Issue Summary

Goal is to integrate basic Cadence editing features into the IntelliJ Platform, an IDE framework developed by JetBrains. Although IntelliJ itself is a Java editor, it is possible to write a plugin that adds Cadence language support to all IntelliJ-based editors (e.g. PyCharm, WebStorm).

> **Winner: Congratulations to squidplay!** 🏆

### Issue Summary

Flow developers use the playground to learn, experiment, and share Cadence code. The current playground model only supports a single account to have a single contract. We want to expand this feature to hold multiple contracts per account.

---

## CLI Feature: [State management](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/22)

> **Winner: Congratulations to the Non Fungibles!** 🏆

### Issue Summary

Flow developers use the playground to learn, experiment, and share Cadence code. The current playground model only supports a single account to have a single contract. We want to expand this feature to hold multiple contracts per account.

---

## Non-React FCL Usage: [Dapp example](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/23)

> **Winner: Congratulations to the Enouvo!** 🏆

### Issue Summary

While using FCL is possible in non-react example, we do not have many examples in the community of this usage. There are some issues with installing the FCL package directly due to packages used to support GRPC.

---

---

## Playground Feature: Improve the resource explorer [#29](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/29)

> **Winner: Congratulations to the Team Exponential!** 🏆

### Issue Summary

In the playground, the resource explorer is the tab the shows the resources inside each account. It is hidden initially and only shows up once you interact with an account's storage. But even then, it only shows up after you click an account, which usually decouples the view a transaction that updates the stored resources.

---

## JS Testing Feature: [Multiple return values from interaction](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/30)

> **Winner: Congratulations to the Team Exponential!** 🏆

### Issue Summary

The JS Testing Framework has two functions: sendTransaction and executeScript that currently return a single result from their execution. It does not have a good way of handling errors that should be caught and processed. This can cause issues with multiple interactions called in succession.

---

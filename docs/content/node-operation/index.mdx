description: How to run your own Flow node
---

To run a Flow node as an operator, first and foremost, 
you need to [Stake locked Flow](/token/staking/locked/node-operators).
This is to ensure that the nodes you operate are eligible for rewards and can be slashed. 
Only stake nodes will be included in Flow network.

Then, setup and bootstrap the node by following the [setup](/operator/node-setup) 
and [bootstrap](/operator/node-bootstrap) guides.

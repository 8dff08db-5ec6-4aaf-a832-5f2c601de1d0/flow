# Getting FLOW tokens

If you're an existing investor, please see details [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b1fVgHBlGYMu0WvIz5fwDMc153UGzXz0Pp2lr1atRrE/)

## Step 1: Get a Flow account

For developers who want to create their own accounts https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk#creating-an-account

If you'd like to get FLOW fast, create an account via [Flow Dock](insert link) or one of the following community members which can create and/or manage your Flow account.
Account Providers include:

- [Kraken](insert link)
- [Finoa](insert link)
- []()
- []()

If you'd like to become a FLOW custody provider on Flow you can find more information on how to integrate here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b1fVgHBlGYMu0WvIz5fwDMc153UGzXz0Pp2lr1atRrE/edit#heading=h.vyfahjj5ho25
//update doc to be general custody providers

You can also create your own account by going to [Flow Dock](Coming soon) and selecting "Create Account" under the transactions option. This will submit a transaction to the Flow Faucet which will sign as the payer to create your account.

## Step 2: Receive FLOW tokens

If you're looking for FLOW tokens, you can join one of our various [community programs](insert link) to receive a token grant or you can wait until tokens are available for purchase.
If you are an existing investor and you'd like to request your Flow tokens please send the address of the account you created above to tokendeliver@onflow.org
If you participated in the Coinlist sale, you will receive your tokens from Coinlist directly within 10-14 days of the sale.

## Developer Support for Allocating Tokens

#### Transaction Template for Transferring Tokens to users### Transfer Tokens

`transaction(amount: UFix64, to: Address) { let vault: @FungibleToken.Vault prepare(signer: AuthAccount) { self.vault <- signer .borrow<&{FungibleToken.Provider}>(from: /storage/flowTokenVault)! .withdraw(amount: amount) } execute { getAccount(to) .getCapability(/public/flowTokenReceiver)! .borrow<&{FungibleToken.Receiver}>()! .deposit(from: <-self.vault) } }`
_First Parameter_
`{ "type": "UFix64", "value": "<integer>.<fractional>" }`
_Second Parameter_
`{ "type": "Address", "value": "0x0" // as hex-encoded string with 0x prefix }`

## Step 3: Start using your FLOW

### Checking your Balance

You can check your FLOW balance at anytime by searching for your address on Flow Dock
//Insert link to flow Dock
Your wallet provider will likely also show your FLOW balance when you login.

#### Developer Support: Exposing FLOW balance

Use the flow-sdk to fetch transaction results https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk#querying-events

- [Fetch account state by address from a Flow Access API](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk#querying-accounts)
  Once the transaction is sealed, an event is emitted and you will be able to read `tx events`\* [Poll for TokenDeposited events using the Flow Acess API](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk#querying-events)

## Staking Your Tokens

Process for Staking Flow

## Delegating

### Unbonding / Withdrawing Stake

- The process for unbonding stake (removing it from the staked node) requires either party to initiate an unbonding request; which is a function call to the staking helper.
- When the request is approved by the core staking contract, the funds will be locked for one epoch and then transferred into the deposit account as set in the initial staking transaction.

# Participating in the Flow validator community

## Step 1: Join the Community & Choose your Role

### Collector Nodes

You should run a Collector if you're a wallet or application that does a lot of interfacing with users. You can ensure their transactions are included quick.

### Consensus Nodes

Run a Consensus node if you're a university, NGO, or other advocacy group committed to maintaining the security and well-being of communities and the networks that power them.

### Execution Nodes

Execution Nodes are presently reserved for those who can provide significant economies of scale to the process of executing transactions.

### Verifier Nodes

You should run a Verification node if you're a responsible citizen or user agent who wants to keep things in check and do their due diligence on the transactions flowing through the network.
For a more in-depth explanation of the various nodes types see here https://docs.onflow.org/docs/node-roles

## Step 2: Rewards

Rewards are paid out proportional to the stake each node operator contributes to its node group. Node groups are assigned rewards based on their revenue ratio which is a coefficient assigned to them based on the security they contribute to the network.
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|Time from Genesis (months)|Annualised Reward Rate for Period|Max Collectors|Max Consensus|Max Execution|Max Verification|
|0-3|20%||29|43|3|73|
|3-9|3.75%|29|43|3|73|
|9+|3.75%||58|86|6|146|
These maximum node numbers were chosen to ensure consistent returns for running a single node of any type (with min. stake). Over time, the number of nodes will increase to promote participation but we don't anticipate increasing the number of participating nodes by more than double in the first year of the network's operation.
The total token supply against which rewards are calculated is 1.25B FLOW.

### Flow Validator Consolidated Guide

Startup your node via the process outlined here
https://docs.onflow.org/docs/node-operation-consolidated-guide

In the event that the node slots are all currently full - you'll need to submit your email to a waiting list [here](https://www.onflow.org/node-validators) so we can notify you when there's room for additional operators.

# Staking & Delegating

### Supporting Third Party Staking & Node Operation

The following is one suggested approach for managing a user's request to stake via coordination between a node operator and independent token holder (or their agent)

## Create Staking Keys

- The node operator generates the following private keys that the staked node will use to authenticate and identify itself within the Flow network:
  - Staking Key
  - Networking Key

## Create a Staking Account

- Custody provider creates a new Flow account that will hold the initial tokens to be staked and (optionally) receive future reward payments.
- The custody provider and their client(s) are the only parties authorized to transfer tokens out of this account.

## Deploy a `StakingHelper` Contract

- The node operator deploys a `StakingHelper` contract initialized with the following parameters:
  - Staking Public Key
  - Staking Key Signature
  - Networking Public Key
  - Networking Key Signature
  - Deposit Account Address
  - Rewards Account Address (can be the same as Staking Account Address)
- The `StakingHelper` is an auditable contract that is _only_ authorized to initiate a staking request to the system-level `FlowStaking` contract. This contract will temporarily hold the staking deposit (tokens to be staked held by custody provider) in escrow before submitting a staking request, and these funds _cannot_ be moved out of the contract for any other purpose. The only exception to this restriction is the `abort` method, which returns the escrowed funds to the initial depositor.

## Deposit Staking Funds

- The custody provider transfers `X` tokens from the staking account to the address of the `StakingHelper` contract.

## Send Staking Request

## Delegating stake

Understanding delegation on Flow
//link to delegation docs? https://docs.onflow.org/docs/delegation

## Withdrawing Stake

- The process for unbonding stake (removing it from the staked node) requires either party to initiate an unbonding request; which is a function call to the staking helper.
- When the request is approved by the core staking contract, the funds will be locked for one epoch and then transferred into the deposit account as set in the initial staking transaction.

## FAQs

_Flow Developer Documentation > Flow Network > Using FLOW_

# Using Testnet FLOW

## Using FLOW for Testing

The Devnet Faucet is a tool for Flow developers to create accounts and fund their accounts with \$FLOW tokens on the Flow Development Network.

# Key Functionality

1. A user should be able to submit a public key to create a new Flow Account.
2. A user should be able to request \$FLOW tokens to be transferred to an account address.

## 1. Creating Accounts

A user visits the faucet webpage and provides the following information:

- Name
- Email Address
- Note (optional)

The page displays the default token allocation they will receive in their new account (e.g. 1000 \$FLOW).

After clicking "Create Account", the UI displays a confirmation message that says "Your account creation request will be reviewed by the Flow team shortly. You will receive an email when your account is created."

## 2. Funding Accounts

If a user already has a Flow account, they can use the faucet webpage to add additional funds to their account.

A user visits the webpage and provides the following information:

- Name
- Email Address
- Note (optional)
- Account Address

The page displays the default token allocation they will receive in their account (e.g. 1000 \$FLOW).

After clicking "Fund Account", the UI displays a confirmation message that says "Your funding request will be reviewed by the Flow team shortly. You will receive an email when the tokens are transferred."

## Deploying Contracts on Testnet

You can deploy a contract on testnet without any special actions - simply submit a transaction with the contract in the script field. Paying for the tx in FLOW, on devnet, will require you to use the Flow Faucet - see above.
//insert link to devnet Faucet

# Using Mainnet FLOW

## Deploying Contracts on Mainnet

Deploying a contract on mainnet will require that you submit your contract for review by a member of the core Cadence team to ensure safety for users.
//Ref Issue to create/link form https://github.com/dapperlabs/flow-internal/issues/1098

## Account Creation

Go to your Flow Dock and select "Create Account" under the transactions option. This will submit a transaction to the Flow Faucet which will sign as the payer to create your account.
//insert link to dock.onflow.org
Funding User accounts
Q: How do I get my first accounts funded?
Q: How do I access free accounts for my users?

## Submitting Transactions to Flow and Result Reporting

On Flow, a transaction is identified by its hash - the hash that exists as soon as that transaction is signed and submitted to an Access or Collection node.
A user can check the status of a transaction at any time via the block explorer.
// link to block explorer
To expose these results natively in your app, you can use the flow-sdk to fetch transaction results via
https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk#querying-events
Once the transaction is sealed, an event is emitted and you will be able to read `tx events`
Transactions are submitted using a Flow SDK via the Access API.
Results of transactions can be queried by transaction hash through the Access API.

## Transaction Anatomy: Payload Signing Information

#### Payload

The transaction _payload_ is the innermost portion of a transaction and contains the data that uniquely identifies the operations applied by the transaction. In Flow, two transactions with the same payload will never be executed more than once.

The transaction _proposer_ and _authorizer_ are only required to sign the transaction payload. These signatures are the **payload signatures**.

#### Authorization Envelope

The transaction _authorization envelope_ contains both the transaction payload and the payload signatures.

The transaction _payer_ is required to sign the authorization envelope. These signatures are the **envelope signatures**.

> ❗ Special case: if an account is both the _payer_ and either a _proposer_ or _authorizer_, it is only required to sign the envelope.

#### Payment Envelope

The outermost portion of the transaction, which contains the payload and envelope signatures, is referred to as the _payment envelope_.

#### Payer Signs Last

The payer must sign the portion of the transaction that contains the payload signatures, which means that the payer must always sign last. This allows the payer to ensure that they are signing a valid transaction with all of the required payload signatures.

#### Signature Structure

A transaction signature is a composite structure containing three fields:

- Address
- Key ID
- Signature Data

The _address_ and _key ID_ fields declare the account key that generated the signature, which is required in order to verify the signature against the correct public key.

### Common Signing Scenarios

Below are several scenarios in which different signature combinations are required to authorize a transaction.

#### Single party, single signature

The simplest Flow transaction declares a single account as the proposer, payer and authorizer. In this case, the account can sign the transaction with a single signature.

Since the proposal key must always have a valid signature, this scenario is only possible if the proposal key has full signing weight.

| Account   | Key ID | Weight |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| `0x01`    | 1      | 1.0    |

```javascript
{
  "payload": {
    "proposalKey": {
      "address": "0x01",
      "keyId": 1,
      "sequenceNumber": 42
    },
    "payer": "0x01",
    "authorizers": [ "0x01" ]
  },
  "payloadSignatures": [], // 0x01 is the payer, so only needs to sign envelope
  "envelopeSignatures": [
    {
      "address": "0x01",
      "keyId": 1,
      "sig": "0xabc123"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Transaction Templates to get you Started

### Transfer Tokens

`transaction(amount: UFix64, to: Address) { let vault: @FungibleToken.Vault prepare(signer: AuthAccount) { self.vault <- signer .borrow<&{FungibleToken.Provider}>(from: /storage/flowTokenVault)! .withdraw(amount: amount) } execute { getAccount(to) .getCapability(/public/flowTokenReceiver)! .borrow<&{FungibleToken.Receiver}>()! .deposit(from: <-self.vault) } }`
_First Parameter_
`{ "type": "UFix64", "value": "<integer>.<fractional>" }`
_Second Parameter_
`{ "type": "Address", "value": "0x0" // as hex-encoded string with 0x prefix }`

### Create Account

`transaction(publicKeys: [[UInt8]]) { prepare(signer: AuthAccount) { let acct = AuthAccount(payer: signer) for key in publicKeys { acct.addPublicKey(key) } } }`
_First Parameter_
`{ "type": "Array", "value": [ { "type": "Array", "value": [ {"type":"UInt8", value: 123}, ... ] }, ... ] }`

### Add New Key

`transaction(publicKey: [UInt8]) { prepare(signer: AuthAccount) { let acct = AuthAccount(payer: signer) acct.addPublicKey(key) } }`
_First Parameter_
`{ "type": "Array", "value": [ {"type":"UInt8", value: 123}, ... ] }`

## Fees

Fees for account creation, and transaction submission will exist in v0.x.x of the testnet.
//update version number and fees applied
There are 2 fees that you will see applied to your transactions

- Account Creation - currently fixed at 0.1 FLOW
- Transaction Fee - currently fixed at 0.0001 FLOW

### Transaction Fees

Transaction fees are applied only once per transaction, at time of execution
Transactions without a valid payer signature will fail and not be included in a block, prior to when the fee would be charged. If there is no one to charge, the transaction never goes through.
However, if a transaction fails for some other reason once it is being executed, you will still be charged the fixed fee. The fee covers the cost of the network looking at the transaction and thus must be paid even if no change to your account is made.

### Storage/Account Fees

Account Creation fee is applied only when create account is called. This fee covers the cost of storing up to 1KB of data in perpetuity.
This fee is applied only once and can be "topped up" to add additional storage to an account.

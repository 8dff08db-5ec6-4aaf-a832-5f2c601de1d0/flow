# FlOW for custody providers

## Supporting Deposits of FLOW

### **Step 1**

Perform necessary KYC and provide user with their Flow address.

It should look like something like `0x7e60df042a9c0868`.

Accounts can be created using a Flow SDK.
For example, accounts can be created using the [Flow Go SDK](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk#creating-an-account).

### **Step 2**

Subscribe to events related to your user's accounts to notify and update account balance in UI.

Accounts can be queried using a Flow SDK.
For example, this can be done using the [Flow Go SDK](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk#querying-accounts).

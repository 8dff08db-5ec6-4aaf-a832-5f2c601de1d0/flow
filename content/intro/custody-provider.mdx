## Unbonding / Withdrawing Stake

- The process for unbonding stake (removing it from the staked node) requires either party to initiate an unbonding request; which is a function call to the staking helper.

- When the request is approved by the core staking contract, the funds will be locked for one epoch and then transferred into the deposit account as set in the initial staking transaction.

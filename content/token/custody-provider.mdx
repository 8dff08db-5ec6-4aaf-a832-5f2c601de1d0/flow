## Supporting Deposits of FLOW

### **Step 1**

Perform necessary KYC and provide user with their Flow address.

It should look like something like `0x7e60df042a9c0868`.

Accounts can be created using a Flow SDK.

### **Step 2**

Subscribe to events related to your user's accounts to notify and update account balance in UI.

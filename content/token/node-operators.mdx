As a node operator, you first need to generate your staking key,
networking address, node ID, and networking key.
Please consult the [guide](https://docs.onflow.org/docs/node-operation-consolidated-guide) to read about how to do that.

You then need to determine the role of node you'll be running.

## Staking

If you hold tokens and want to participate in the network,
you need to [stake](custody-staking-and-delivery#staking) them.

### Staking as a Service & Delegation - Using the Staking Helper

If you do not hold tokens yourself,
but are relying on someone else to run a node on your behalf,
you can [submit a staking request without tokens](custody-staking-and-delivery#staking-helper) -
this will produce the needed node operator object
[created during staking](custody-staking-and-delivery#staking).

## Withdrawing Rewards

Rewards are deposited into your pool of unlocked tokens
which you can [withdraw at anytime](custody-staking-and-delivery#withdrawing-rewards).

## Unbonding / Withdrawing Stake

Stake can be [unbonded / withdrawn](custody-staking-and-delivery.mdx#unbonding-/-withdrawing-stake).

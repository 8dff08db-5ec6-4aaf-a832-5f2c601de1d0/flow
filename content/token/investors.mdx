description: How to claim FLOW tokens as an investor
---

Follow the process outlined below if you would like to:

- Claim tokens purchased in a previous sale
- Purchase or hold FLOW in the future

## Step 1: Choose a Custody Provider

Choose a custody provider who currently supports Flow:

- Coinlist
- Finoa
- Kraken
- Ledger, or
- Create your own Flow account by going to [Flow Port](#) and selecting "Create Account" under the transactions option. You will only be able to use this option if you currently hold an account on the network with the ability to pay for the account creation fees.

## Step 2: Create an Account

Your chosen custody service will provide you with an option to create a `Flow Address`.
Account addresses for managing funds and signing transactions are created as follows:

1. The user (or user's agent)
   1. generates the private account key (off-chain)
   2. prepares a Cadence script to create their own account
2. Dapper Labs
    1. co-signs the account creation transaction (for authorization, and payment)
    2. submits the transaction to the network

Once the account creation transaction has been executed and the result sealed,
the user can use their private key to authorize transactions through their account
(generally this is done through a wallet provider).

The exact steps to complete this may vary by custody provider but they will require a thorough KYC process.

**You are done this step when you receive your Flow Address.**

It should look like something like: `0x7e60df042a9c0868`

You can read more about address generation in the [accounts & keys documentation](/concepts/accounts-and-keys#account-addresses).
## Step 3: Claim Your Tokens

Provide the [Flow team](mailto:) your Flow Address and the tokens will be deposited into your account shortly.

You will be able to **check your FLOW balance** at any time on [Flow Port](#).

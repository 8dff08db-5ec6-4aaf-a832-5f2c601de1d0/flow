description: Investor guide for purchasing and claiming FLOW tokens
---

Follow the process outlined below if you would like to:

- Claim tokens purchased in a previous sale
- Purchase or hold FLOW in the future

#### **Step 1: Choosing a custody provider**

Choose a custody provider who currently supports Flow:

- Coinlist
- Finoa
- Kraken
- Ledger, or
- Create your own Flow account by going to [Flow Port](#) and selecting "Create Account" under the transactions option.
  This will submit a transaction to the [Flow Faucet](#) which will sign as the payer to create your account.

#### **Step 2: Account creation**

Your chosen custody service will provide you with an option to create a `Flow Address`.
Account addresses for managing funds and signing transactions are created as follows:

1. The user (or user's agent)
   1. generates the private account key (off-chain)
   2. prepares a Cadence script to create their own account
2. Dapper Labs
    1. co-signs the account creation transaction (for authorization, and payment)
    2. submits the transaction to the network

Once the account creation transaction has been executed and the result sealed,
the user can use their private key to authorize transactions through their account
(generally this is done through a wallet provider).

The exact steps to complete this may vary by custody provider but they will require a thorough KYC process.

**You are done this step when you receive your Flow Address.**

It should look like something like: `0x7e60df042a9c0868`

#### Flow Addresses: Technical Details

For Flow addresses, a linear code [64, 45, 7] is used as an error-detection code.
The address of the i-th account created on Flow is simply the codeword corresponding to the original value (i).
This linear code allows generating 2^45 distinct addresses, each address is encoded over 64 bits.
Two different addresses are guaranteed to have at least 7 different bits which reduces the risk of confusing two addresses.

Moreover, the linear code used is non-systematic, which means it's not possible to separate the extra bits from the original value bits in the codeword.
This makes the generated addresses look like random numbers and two consecutive account addresses look very different.
A quick off-chain test can tell if a 64 bits word could be a valid Flow address.

The generation of an account address is an on-chain mechanism that happens when a Flow network receives an account creation transaction.
The network keeps track of the number of accounts already created and returns the newly created address.

#### **Step 3**

Provide the [Flow team](mailto:) your Flow Address and the tokens will be deposited into your account shortly.

You will be able to **check your FLOW balance** anytime on [Flow Port](#)

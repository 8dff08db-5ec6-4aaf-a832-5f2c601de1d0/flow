Before starting your journey on Flow we recommend reading the <a href="https://www.onflow.org/primer">Flow Primer</a> where you will get a quick introduction to how the Flow blockchain works. It will be easier to understand the concepts in these tutorials if you have an idea of how Flow works.

## Install Flow

To work with Flow locally you'll need to install the <a href="https://github.com/dapperlabs/flow-cli">Flow CLI</a>.
The Flow CLI is a command-line interface that provides useful utilities for building Flow applications, including the Flow Emulator.

<MenuTitle>OSX & Linux</MenuTitle>

```shell
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://storage.googleapis.com/flow-cli/install.sh)"
```

<MenuTitle>Windows</MenuTitle>

```powershell
iex "& { $(irm 'https://storage.googleapis.com/flow-cli/install.ps1') }"
```

## Developer Tools

Flow was designed for builders. It's a "batteries included" patform complete with developer tools you can use to start building right away.

<!-- ## Cadence Smart Contracts

Blockchain represents a new paradigm on how scarce resources are being created and managed in the digital world. That is why Flow supports a new smart contract language, Cadence, following a <a href="">resource-oriented</a> paradigm inspired by linear types.
Cadence allows for a more natural representation of scarce resources and it is designed for developers to build safer smart contracts.

<!-- ### Building Applications on Flow

When choosing to build on a blockchain platform like Flow, it's important to consider how you want to handle transaction signing and storing information about your users.

<MenuWrapper>

<WorkoutMenuItem

  keyWord="Hybrid"
  otherWords="Applications"
>
Build an application that lets user's manage their own Flow account access using a wallet, but also store some information about individual users in a database, and provide some server-side functionality that interacts with Flow.
